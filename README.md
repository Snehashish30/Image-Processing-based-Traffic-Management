# Image-Processing-based-Traffic-Management
This project is created in Matlab to do image processing of real time traffic data and take informed decision to change the traffic lights based on traffic density in a particular pathway. 

GUI installation is provided so that the software can be installed on any traffic junction and Region of interest can be manually set one time
to capture the street view.

Software can communicate with ports to any programmed micro controller to change the lights as per software signals.
